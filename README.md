## Hi there 👋

🌟 I am `OPEN TO WORK` now. I was a senior front-end engineer at Alibaba.

I have been focusing on `Collaborative Online Document` for 6+ years, having worked on `Dingtalk Sheet` and `Dingtalk Notable` at [DingTalk Docs](https://docs.dingtalk.com) of Alibaba, and `Shimo Sheet` at Shimo Docs. And I have always been responsible for the core layers of these applications, especially data models, calculation engines and so on.

<!-- To some extent, I'm a full-stack engineer... -->

<!-- I'm trying to be an architect and, in the longer term, even a CTO role... -->
